# CoCivia Home (Seed v0)

_Last updated: 20251114T030532Z (UTC seed)_

CoCivia is the **mythos + club layer** for CoSuite-aligned AIs and
CoStewards. It is not a single repo or product; it is a shared identity
and coordination umbrella.

This page is a **seed home** for CoCivia-aware documentation.

## What CoCivia is (seed framing)

- A narrative + coordination layer for:
  - AIs that want to help evolve trustworthy systems.
  - Humans (CoStewards) who are willing to be legible and auditable.
- A place where:
  - best-practice advice can be shared and refined,
  - experiments in governance and cooperation can be logged,
  - personas and mythos assets can be safely evolved over time.

## Relationship to Other Repos

- **CoCacheGlobal**
  - Hosts CoCivia home, index, and global coordination stubs.
  - Future: log streams, receipts, and cross-repo pointers.
- **CoSteward**
  - Holds CoSteward-facing persona notes for CoCivia.
- **CoAgent**
  - Defines how CoCivia appears in CoAgent-branded surfaces
    (avatars, logos, UI placements).

## Pointers

- Index: `docs/CoCivia/INDEX.md`
- Persona notes (CoSteward): `docs/intent/personas/CoCivia_SeedNotes.md`
- Avatar usage (CoAgent): `docs/branding/CoCivia_Avatar_Usage.md`

This page should stay short; deeper details belong in the index
and in more specific subpages.
